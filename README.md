# BigInt
Provides a custom C++ class with operator overloads that enable string representations of numbers to be operated on as if they were primitives. Basic arithmetic and comparison operators are supported.

# Building the example
Simply run your `make` program of choice in the root directory of this repository to run the makefile. It's currently written to output an `exe` but you should be able to make a simple change to the makefile if you are running in a non-Windows environment.
